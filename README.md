# Finding Keywords Based on Three Corpus Linguistics Techniques

## Abstract
This study applies three corpus linguistics techniques: frequency list, association score and correspondence analysis, investigating the most relative keywords or topics from the United Unions General Debate corpus in two decades - from 2001 to 2010 and from 2011 to 2011. The findings in this study include 1) a comparison of selection criteria among the three techniques. 2) different sets of keywords or topics generated from the different techniques. 3) limitations of the different techniques.
